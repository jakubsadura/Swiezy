The Input directory contains data files that are used by the tests.

The data is structured by folders: Cardio, Biometric, Angio, ...

For each libmodule, the Data/CorrectOutput directory contains valid 
output data created by tests. Output data of the current test are 
compared with these valid output data during regression testing.
